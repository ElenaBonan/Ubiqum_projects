# Ubiqum_projects (2018)
In this folder there are two projects that I did during the course in Machine Learning at Ubiqum in 2018. The code is written in R and to visualize the notebook you can use the links provided. Indeed, the html produced by the R Markdown is saved in the docs folder and it is published using Github Pages.

- <b>Energy Consumption </b> In this project we studied the consumption of energy of a family during four years. We did some descriptive analysis and time series forcasting.
- <b>Wifi ></b>
