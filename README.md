# Ubiqum_projects (2018)
In this folder there are two projects that I did during the course in Machine Learning at Ubiqum in 2018. The code is written in R. To visualize the notebook you can use the links provided. Indeed, the html produced by the R Markdown is saved in the docs folder and it is published using Github Pages.

- <b>Energy Consumption </b> In this project I studied the consumption of energy of a family during four years. I did some descriptive analysis and time series forcasting.
- <b> Wifi fingerprint based localisation</b> In this project I predicted the position of a person inside a building using the signals received on the phone from the Wifi Acess points of the buildings. The model involved both classification and regression problems.
