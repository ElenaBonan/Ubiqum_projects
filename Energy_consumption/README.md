# Energy Consumption
The goal of the project was to show which useful information a family can get if they use submetering devices for monitoring the consumption of energy. We studied the data about the energy consumption of a family during four years. In particular, for every minute we knew the total energy consumption and the consumption in the three submetering devices of the house. After we had cleaned the data and we had taken care of the missing values, we did some intresting graphics about the consumption of energy using different time aggregation. Finally, we forecasted the monthly energy consumption applying different models on time series, like ARIMA and Holt-Winter.
