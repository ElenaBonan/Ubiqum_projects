I studied the data about the energy consumption of a family for four years. More precisely, for every minute I  knew the total energy consumption and the electricity used in the three submetering devices of the house. After having cleaned the data and taking care of the missing values, I did some descriptive statistics regarding the habits of the family and the behaviour of the electrical devices. Finally, I forecasted the monthly energy consumption for the following year. I applied different models on time series, like ARIMA and Holt-Winter.

- The Dataset
- The R script used to do descriptive analysis and forecasting.
- A PowerPoint presentation of the findings.
